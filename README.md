# 🕸️ Web Scraping & Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates how to extract data from a live website using Python and perform basic analysis using `pandas`.

## Overview

In this project, I used **BeautifulSoup** and **requests** to scrape tabular data from a live website. The extracted HTML content was parsed and cleaned using **pandas**, followed by exporting the clean dataset to a CSV file.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- BeautifulSoup
- requests
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
- HTML parsing and data extraction
- Data cleaning and transformation using pandas
- Exporting structured data to CSV
- Basic exploratory analysis
